My SE361 project

  
Project Description
  The goal for this project was to give students a taste of what processes occur when developing an application in the real world using an iterative process. Therefore, the professor gave each group a lot of freedom to develop the application in their own ways, as well as de-scoping the project, given that the group had a valid explanation, of course. Each group wrote their documentation (use cases, class diagrams, etc) their own way, which resulted in varying approaches being performed by each group. Even though all groups were given the same assignment, by the end of the semester each group's application was distinct in its appearance and construction, as well as its capabilities.
