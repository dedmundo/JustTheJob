My SE361 project

  
Project Description:
  The goal for this project was to give students a taste of what processes occur when developing an application in the real world using an iterative process. Therefore, the professor gave each group a lot of freedom to develop the application in their own ways, as well as de-scoping the project, given that the group had a valid explanation, of course. Each group wrote their documentation (use cases, class diagrams, etc) their own way, which resulted in varying approaches being performed by each group. Even though all groups were given the same assignment, by the end of the semester each group's application was distinct in its appearance and construction, as well as its capabilities.

Generic Information:
  This project was created by our group (3 of us total) using Visual Studio and the .NET programming language. The executable file can be found in to project's Bin -> Debug Folder.
  
Contents:
  This project includes:
    -An executable file
    -All files used to create the application, including documentation
    -The Project description given to us by the professor
    -Our group's final report that was turned in at the end of the semester
